# VLRScrape

This script can be used to get all the data of matches which are represented on [VLR Match Result Page](https://vlr.gg/matches/results/). 

#### Why I developed this?
I'm working on image processing project called [ViperWalls](https://github.com/ocnow/ViperWalls) for which I wanted to select matches in which specific agents were used. I was going to write script just to get agent data but decided why the hell not just get all data.

I hope somebody finds this repo useful.
